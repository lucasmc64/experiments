# :woman_technologist: Workplace Control

> This was a project developed as an exercise for an internship at Obuc.

## :dart: Goal

With the advent of the pandemic and the migration of much of the "non-essential" work to the Home Office model, there was a greater need for tools to control the workplaces of your employees.

## :scroll: Some details

- The front end is made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## :thinking: How to run the project on my machine? 

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements

There are no requirements to run the project on your computer! Just double click on the *index.html* file and it will open in your default browser.

## :tada: If everything went well...

Now you are running the project beautifully!
