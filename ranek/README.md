> This was a project developed during the [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/) [React course](https://www.origamid.com/curso/react-completo/).

## :wolf: What is Origamid?

Origamid is an online education institution created by AndrÃ© Rafael with the aim of transmitting his knowledge in Front-end and UI&UX.

## :dart: Goal 

Share your adventures and your little dog with people who have the same passion for the little ones.

## :scroll: Some details 

- The font-end is built with ReactJS.

## :thinking: How do I run the project on my machine? 

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements 

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/).
- (Optional) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### :mag: Installing dependencies 

With Node.JS installed, access each project directory via terminal and run the `npm install` command. If you prefer to use Yarn, just run the command `yarn`.

### :sparkles: Running the Frontend

With the dependencies properly installed, still in the terminal, run `npm start` or ` yarn start`. A message similar to the following will appear for you:

![Result of the command in the terminal](readme-images/running-frontend.png)

Now just access the address *http://localhost:3000* in your favorite browser, to see the project running.

> If this was not the result, check that the requirements and previous steps have been fulfilled.

### :tada: If everything went well... 

Now you are running the project beautifully!
